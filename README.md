# UI3 Icons

Welcome to UI3 Icons! This project offers a comprehensive set of **polished, cleaned up, and optimized UI3 icons**. These icons are meticulously **built using base shapes sourced from the UI3 community file provided by Figma**, ensuring high quality and consistency.

Whether you need standalone SVGs or framework-specific components, UI3 Icons provides flexible options to integrate beautiful icons into your projects.

## Usage

You can use UI3 icons in your project in three primary ways:

### 1. Standalone SVG Icons (`@ui3/icons`)

This package provides individual, optimized SVG files. This is an excellent option if you need full control over the SVG assets, are working in an environment without a specific JavaScript framework, or prefer to manage your assets directly.

**Installation:**
```bash
npm install @ui3/icons
```
**Learn more and see all available icons:** [**`@ui3/icons` README**](./packages/icons/README.md)

### 2. React Components (`@ui3/react`)

For React applications, we offer a set of ready-to-use components. Each icon is wrapped in a React component for easy integration, allowing you to import and use them just like any other React component.

**Installation:**
```bash
npm install @ui3/react
```
**Learn more about usage and props:** [**`@ui3/react` README**](./packages/react/README.md)

### 3. Vue Components (`@ui3/vue`)

If you're using Vue.js (version 3 or later), you can use our dedicated Vue components for seamless integration. These components are designed to work perfectly within the Vue ecosystem.

**Installation:**
```bash
npm install @ui3/vue
```
**Learn more about usage and props:** [**`@ui3/vue` README**](./packages/vue/README.md)
